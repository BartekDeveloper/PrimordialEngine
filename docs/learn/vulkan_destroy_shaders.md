# `shaders.odin` (in `vulkan/destroy`)

This file provides a procedure for destroying Vulkan shaders.

## `Shaders` procedure

This procedure is a placeholder for destroying Vulkan shaders. It is currently empty, as shader modules are typically destroyed when the logical device is destroyed or when the `CleanUpShaderModules` procedure in `src/engine/vulkan/load/shaders.odin` is called.
