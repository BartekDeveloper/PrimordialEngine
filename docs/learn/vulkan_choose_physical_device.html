        <p>This file contains the logic for selecting the most suitable physical device (i.e., GPU) for the application.</p>
        <h2><code>PhysicalDevicesData</code> procedure</h2>
        <p>This procedure enumerates all available physical devices and scores them based on their capabilities. The device with the highest score is then selected for use.</p>
        <p>The scoring is based on a number of factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device type:</strong> Discrete GPUs are preferred over integrated GPUs.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue families:</strong> The device must support graphics, present, and compute queues.</li>
            <li><strong>Features:</strong> The device must support all the required features, such as sampler anisotropy.</li>
            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> The device's properties, such as the maximum image dimensions and the maximum number of samplers, are also taken into account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The procedure returns a <code>t.PhysicalDeviceData</code> struct, which contains all the relevant information about the selected device.</p>
